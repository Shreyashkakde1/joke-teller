# Joke Teller Web App
Project Description

The Joke Teller is a web application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver jokes to the user with text-to-speech capabilities. The application is designed to be responsive, so it can be used on desktop, tablet, or mobile devices.

The primary feature of the Joke Teller is the ability to generate jokes at the click of a button. The app has a simple user interface with a large button that reads "Tell Me A Joke" and a text box that displays the joke once it is generated. When the button is clicked, the app retrieves a joke from a joke API and uses the browser's text-to-speech capabilities to read the joke aloud to the user.

The application also has a responsive design, so it looks great on any device. The layout is optimized for small screens, with a minimalistic design that ensures that the user can easily access the joke button and text box on any screen size. The app also features a clean and modern design, with a simple color palette that makes it easy to read the joke text and navigate the interface.

The Joke Teller uses JavaScript to connect to a joke API and retrieve a random joke. The app is built on top of the Bootstrap framework, which provides the responsive layout and grid system used in the app's design. The app also leverages the Web Speech API, a JavaScript API that allows developers to integrate text-to-speech functionality into web applications.

In summary, the Joke Teller is a simple and fun web application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver jokes with text-to-speech capabilities. Its responsive design ensures that it can be used on any device, and its clean and modern design make it a pleasure to use.
